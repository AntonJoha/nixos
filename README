# What is this

This is my nixos config. 
It's purely made for me to have a similar setup between both desktop and laptop.

It's not perfect right now however. Boot folder isn't the same for each for example. 
This means that the hardware and configuration nix files are not going to be the same for both systems.
Modify after need.

You also need to manually link by yourself from this folder to /etc/nixos and ./config.

__WARNING__ do not link this whole folder to .config or something similar as other applications containing sensitive data might store it in .config. 
It's therefore too easy to upload something sensitive.
